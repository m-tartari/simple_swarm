The package allows to simulate and visualize the behavior of swarms of
individuals (in a very very rough way, which is merely a pretext for the
evaluation). Here, the individuals follow a virtual leader, which is
a point in the x,y plane that can be randomly reset.

The swarm_node type corresponds to one individual of the swarm.
The swarm_behavior type represents the virtual leader of the swarm and
is used to randomly reset the virtual leader when a certain key is hit.
Typically, capture_key is used to transmit the keystrokes to 
swarm_behavior nodes.
